# Brightbridge Council Challenge - Front End Development

Brightbridge Council are an EarthSense customer that have purchased a fleet of Zephyrs (air quality sensors). Your task is to create a React application that allows the council to see each of their Zephyrs along with their latest pollution measurements.

### Things to Note

In the utils.ts file, you will find:

1. An array of Brightbridge's Zephyrs, including various pieces of metadata as well as the latest pollution measurements they have taken.
2. A colourscale for the pollution measurements ranging from 1 to 10.

### Things to Do

1. Display the name, type, battery charge, NO₂, and PM₂.₅ measurements for each Zephyr in a list.
2. Order the list so that standard Zephyr types are displayed before enhanced Zephyr types.
3. Some of the Zephyrs listed are no longer owned by Brightbridge Council - remove these from the list.
4. Use the colourscale to display a colour associated with each Zephyr. You should base this color on the highest value between the NO₂ and PM₂.₅ measurements.
5. Add a filter that allows the council to show either: all Zephyrs, standard Zephyrs alone, or enhanced Zephyrs alone.
6. Do pay attention to styles and how you can present the information in a clean, engaging way for the council.

Please provide a copy of your code in a publicly accessible location (e.g. Github, Bitbucket etc) when you're done.
